# 🚀 DCA Calculator by LVKSH ©

A simple **Dollar Cost Averaging** calculator built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.

This project simulates monthly investing with **compound interest** and shows how consistent contributions grow over time. You can choose whether investments are made at the beginning or at the end of each month, and see the **total portfolio value**, **invested capital**, **profit** and **ROI**.

The calculation is based on a standard **compound interest model**:

**monthly_rate = (1 + APY)^(1/12) - 1**

To run locally:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dca-calculator.git  
cd dca-calculator  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
streamlit run src/dca_calculator/app.py  


⚠️ *This simulation does not take into account inflation, taxes, fees or market volatility. It is intended for educational and illustrative purposes only.*
